This script is to be run as a cron-job every half an hour at 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.

It will check if the Toronto Maple Leafs game is about to start using the schedule from ESPN and then launch the live radio stream in VLC player.

I wrote this script to give me some more experience learning Ruby which I am currently trying to learn.
